Role Variables
--------------

There are many variables that control the operation of this role, they are documented in the
[defaults/main.yml](https:defaults/main.yml) file.

Dependencies
------------

The `nmusatti.docker_ce` role is used to install Docker Community Edition.

The `nmusatti.source_python` role is used to install Python from source.

The `waco_org.waco_python` is used to customize Python installations.

The `geerlingguy.repo-epel` role is used to enable the EPEL repository on CentOS.

The `bobbyrenwick.pip` role is used to install pip.

Example Playbook
----------------

Consider using the [waco-bootstrap](https://github.com/waco-org/waco-bootstrap.git) project to apply
the `waco-master` role to newly installed computers. Otherwise you can invoke it directly, in
which case you might want to copy and customize the `defaults/main.yml` file, and pass it as a
variable file:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - role: waco_org.waco_master
           vars_file: my_defaults.yml
